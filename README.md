# Coding-With-Qiskit---1.x
This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks I created when I took **the Coding With Qiskit - 1. x class on the Qiskit Youtube Channel.**

I have to highlight that the original work corresponds to IBM members, in particular *Dr. Derek Wang* whom I enjoyed his videos about quantum computing.

The notebooks will give you a fundamental understanding of Qiskit, especially the new updates it received on version 1.0.
To run these notebooks, you would need to install MiniConda (or Anaconda). 
Then, follow this video to install all the packages you will need: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZWz4Gs_BuI&list=PLOFEBzvs-VvrgHZt3exM_NNiNKtZlHvZi&index=3&ab_channel=Qiskit

*Installing some packages will take some time, so be patient!!*
**But, I can tell you learning Qiskit was fun for me and it will be for you too !!**
